# 💻 Computer Sales Analysis (Python & Statistics)

## 📌 Project Description
This project analyzes computer sales data using Python and statistical methods to understand pricing patterns, product features, and market behavior. The objective is to apply probability, sampling, and hypothesis testing techniques to evaluate price stability, feature impact, and differences across product categories.

The project focuses on using statistics to support data-driven decisions in pricing and product strategy.

## 📈 Key Insights
- The average selling price is stable and remains close to **$2,200** across the market.
- **45% of systems** include multimedia features, making it a key product differentiator.
- Sampling results closely match the population mean, confirming data reliability.
- Premium systems have a **lower average price ($2,204)** compared to non-premium systems (**$2,362**).
- The presence of a **CD drive does not impact selling price**, indicating reduced relevance.
